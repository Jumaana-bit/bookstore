# Digital Library Application

## Overview

The Digital Library application is a web-based platform designed to provide access to a collection of digital books without the need for borrowing. It serves as an online repository where users can explore and read books directly on the site. The inspiration for this website comes from the Internet Archive, and all the books included are under the public domain.

## Features

- Display a collection of digital books with their details (title, author, and cover image).
- Allow users to read books directly on the website using an embedded PDF viewer.
- Responsive design for optimal viewing across various devices.
- Simple and intuitive user interface for easy navigation through the library.

## Technologies Used

- **Spring Boot** for backend development and RESTful services.
- **Thymeleaf** as the template engine for server-side rendering.
- **Bootstrap 5** for responsive and modern CSS design.
- **Java Persistence API (JPA)** for data persistence.
- **H2 Database** for an in-memory database during development.
